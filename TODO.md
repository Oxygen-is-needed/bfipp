# Ideas

- ALL
    - Move Define Configuration options macros to "config.hpp"
    - Write docs on creating frontends
    - Write docs on creating backend
- Main
    - Option to output parsed file
    - REPL for BF
    - Verbose levels
- Backend
    - Remove need for seek and seekb operations.
        - Have rule for the charactors to seek in those functions
    - Step Back one step
    - Optimize
    - Convert necessary variables to unsigned long
    - Add output buffer
    - Add input buffer
    - Support for multicharactor tokens
    - Support for Huffman Coding binary files.
    - Other Langs
        - Support for bf++?: https://esolangs.org/wiki/BF%2B%2B
        - Support for boolf\*\*k? https://esolangs.org/wiki/Boolfuck
        - Support for sembly? https://esolangs.org/wiki/Sembly
- Frontend
    - Heat map for which tokens are access the most.
    - Simple Text
        - Add base number at end of numbers, to know index of each. (e.g. '1''2''3''4' 10 = 11, 12, 13, 14)
        - Run till spicific amount of steps.
        - Input buffer?
        - Wait till break out of loop.
        - add keybinds to extend inspect
